        <p>Here we will learn how it's done. Enjoy!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="Ingredients">
            <li>100g of butter</li>
            <li>200g of Marie biscuit or similar</li>
            <li>220g of brown sugar</li>
            <li>80g of President semi-cured cheese or similar</li>
            <li>350g of Philadelphia cream cheese or similar</li>
            <li>150g of Mascarpone cheese</li>
            <li>3 eggs and 2 yolks</li>
            <li>300g of whipping cream</li>
            <li>5g of salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol class="Steps">
            <li>Crush the cookies and mix them with melted butter. Put it in the bottom of the container that we are going to use and let it cool in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (356°F), while you're doing the recipe.</li>
            <li>Mix all the cheeses until there is a uniform mixture.</li>
            <li>Add the sugar and beat it until there are no lumps.</li>
            <li>By hand, with a whisk we mix the eggs in the mixture.</li>
            <li>Last but not least, put the cream and mix it (don't beat it, or whip the cream).</li>
            <li>Put the butter on the edges of the mold.</li>
            <li>Put the mixture in the container (should be 3/4 of the mold).</li>
            <li>Bake at 180°C for 30 minutes. Remove it and let it cool at room temperature until cold or set.</li>
        </ol>
